Analysts at Goldman Sachs note that a stock price index of 200 SPACs (pre- and post-merger) has badly underperformed the market this year, down 17 percent versus a 10 percent gain in the S&P 500. SPACs have also lagged an index of unprofitable tech stocks, suggesting that investors have particular concerns about SPACs, because plenty of them have acquired other unprofitable tech companies.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/22/business/stock-market-today/after-a-COVID-19?ood-in-the-first-quarter-spac-listings-have-slowed-to-a-trickle<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>After a COVID-19?ood in the first quarter, SPAC listings have slowed to a trickle.<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>Why are investors so worried about SPACs?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>Why are investors so worried about SPACs?
