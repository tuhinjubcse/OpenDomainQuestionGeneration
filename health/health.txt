<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>Studies have linked anosmia to social isolation and anhedonia, an inability to feel pleasure, as well as a strange sense of detachment and isolation. Memories and emotions are intricately tied to smell, and the olfactory system plays an important though largely unrecognized role in emotional well-being, said Dr. Sandeep Robert Datta, an associate professor of neurobiology at Harvard Medical School.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/health/coronavirus-smell-taste.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Some Covid Survivors Haunted by Loss of Smell and Taste<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>Why is anosmia so common?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>Why is anosmia an inability to feel pleasure?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>British scientists studied the experiences of 9,000 Covid-19 patients who joined a Facebook support group set up by the charity group AbScent between March 24 and September 30. Many members said they had not only lost pleasure in eating, but also in socializing. The loss had weakened their bonds with other people, affecting intimate relationships and leaving them feeling isolated, even detached from reality.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/health/coronavirus-smell-taste.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Some Covid Survivors Haunted by Loss of Smell and Taste<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>What is the Facebook support group for people who have lost their appetite?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>Why does losing pleasure in eating make you depressed?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>Loss of smell is a risk factor for anxiety and depression, so the implications of widespread anosmia deeply trouble mental health experts.

<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>The most immediate effects may be nutritional. People with anosmia may continue to perceive basic tastes — salty, sour, sweet, bitter and umami. But taste buds are relatively crude preceptors. Smell adds complexity to the perception of flavor via hundreds of odor receptors signaling the brain.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/health/coronavirus-smell-taste.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Some Covid Survivors Haunted by Loss of Smell and Taste<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>What are the most immediate effects of anosmia on our taste buds/preceptors?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>What does anosmia have to do with taste?

<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>Dr. Thomas Campbell, who is overseeing the trial site at UCHealth in Colorado, said he has received more than 2,000 emails and hundreds of calls from would-be volunteers. He said excitement over the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines has stoked interest in getting immunized, but their scarcity is leading some people to investigate other options. The news about Novavax’s trial in Britain has also boosted enthusiasm: 224 people have enrolled so far at his site.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/health/vaccine-novavax.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>After a Rocky Start, Novavax Vaccine Could Be Here by Summer<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>Why is there so much interest in getting immunized?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>Why is there so much interest in the Novavax vaccine and who is overseeing the trial?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>But any number of obstacles could trip up Novavax’s progress. As other vaccines become more widely available, participants in Novavax’s trial could drop out of the trial. Even though its results in Britain were promising, the U.S. study could yield different results. Or the company could fail to prove to regulators that it can reliably manufacture its vaccine on a large scale. Given the likelihood that the United States may soon have three authorized vaccines available to the public, the company is under pressure to move quickly, or risk losing ground to competitors.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/health/vaccine-novavax.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>After a Rocky Start, Novavax Vaccine Could Be Here by Summer<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>What could trip up Novavax’s progress?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>Why is Novavax taking so long to develop a vaccine?

<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>Daniel Larremore, an epidemiologist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and the study’s lead author, stressed that his team’s work was still purely theoretical. Although some smell tests are already in use in clinical and research settings, the products tend to be expensive and laborious to use and are not widely available. And in the context of the pandemic, there is not yet real-world data to support the effectiveness of smell tests as a frequent screen for the coronavirus. Given the many testing woes that have stymied pandemic control efforts so far, some experts have been doubtful that smell tests could be distributed widely enough, or made sufficiently cheat-proof, to reduce the spread of infection.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/health/smell-test-for-covid.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Could a Smell Test Screen People for Covid?<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>How do smell tests work?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>Why is it so hard to use smell tests in a pandemic?
