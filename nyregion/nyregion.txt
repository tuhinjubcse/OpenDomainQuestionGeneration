<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>Both Mr. McGuire and his most powerful supporters recognize that the path to City Hall runs through neighborhoods far from his duplex in the famed San Remo building on Central Park West.

<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>Buggy websites, multiple sign-up systems that act in parallel but do not link together and a lack of outreach are causing exasperation and exhaustion among older New Yorkers and others trying to set up vaccination appointments.

<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>Acid attacks occur worldwide, but are especially common in a few countries, including Pakistan, India, the United Kingdom and Uganda, according to the London-based Acid Survivors Trust International.
