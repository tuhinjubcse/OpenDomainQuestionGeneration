<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>Heat and dryness have a particularly strong effect on the conditions that lead to wildfires, decreasing moisture in the soil and drying vegetation so that it ignites more readily and burns hotter.

Warming causes soil to lose moisture through evaporation, which has a cooling effect on the surface of the ground, much as evaporation of sweat from skin causes a person to cool down. But eventually so much soil moisture is lost that the process stops.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/climate/drought.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Severe Drought, Worsened by Climate Change, Ravages the American West<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>How does "warming" cause soil to dry out?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>How does soil cooling work?

Though its symptoms sometimes mirror those of clinical anxiety, she said she saw eco-distress as a reasonable reaction to scientific facts — one that, in mild cases, should be addressed but not pathologized.

The agency’s investments in shale-gas technology in the 1970s laid the groundwork for the fracking boom.

The Obama administration famously used these standards to help phase out traditional incandescent light bulbs in favor of models that consumed less electricity. The Trump administration, by contrast, loosened many of these standards, which sometimes face opposition from industry groups.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/climate/jennifer-granholm-senate-confirmation.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>‘Energy’ Is Its Name.

Although a handful of other six-star systems have been discovered, this one is unique: It is the first in which the stars within each of those three pairings pass in front of and behind each other, eclipsing the other member of its stellar dance troupe, at least from our space telescope’s line of sight.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/23/science/six-stars-eclipses.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Six Stars, Six Eclipses: ‘The Fact That It Exists Blows My Mind’<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>What is this sextuplet at the galactic center?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>What is a sextuplet?

<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>In the 1990s, interpretations of archaeological research led to the proposal that the Cahokians at the height of their city’s population had cut down many trees in the area.

In the 1860s, bluffs upstream from Cahokia were cleared for coal mining, causing enough localized flooding to bury some of the settlement’s sites. European deforestation created a deep overlying layer of eroded sediment, distinct from the soils of the pre-contact floodplain.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/science/cahokia-mounds-floods.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>What Doomed a Sprawling City Near St. Louis 1,000 Years Ago?<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>What caused the destruction of Cahokia in St.Louis?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>How did Cahokia get buried by bluffs and flooding?

<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>In 1980, three astronomers, Mitchell Begelman, Martin Rees and Roger Blandford, wrote about how these black holes would alter the evolution of the galaxies they inhabit. When two galaxies collided and merged — an especially common event in the earlier universe — their central black holes would meet and form a binary system, two black holes circling each other.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/science/astronomy-black-hole-abell.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Missing: One Black Hole With 10 Billion Solar Masses<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>How do black holes work?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>How do black holes change the evolution of the galaxies they inhabit?
