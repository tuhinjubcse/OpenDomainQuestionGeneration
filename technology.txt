<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>A panel of talking heads encouraged the women to buy and hold Bitcoin as an investment — even just $5 or $25.

<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>It was the kind of conversation happening in group texts, Twitter threads, Zoom rooms and Clubhouse panels across the country as the once-niche world of digital currencies has invaded the mainstream via art, sports, entertainment and media. In the process, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have gone from curiosity to punchline to viable investment. They have made a lot of people very rich — making the entire category harder than ever to ignore.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/technology/cryptocurrency-mainstream.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>We’re All Crypto People Now<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>What is Bitcoin and why is everyone talking about it?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>How has the once-niche world of digital currencies invaded the mainstream?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>NFT sales have also had issues with impersonation, faked transactions, tokens not being delivered, glitchy auction websites and sellers struggling to cash out their payments. There are concerns over the energy consumed in such transactions, along with how to preserve access to crypto art that is hosted on sites that could go out of business.

<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>No matter what their goals are — moving a stock, overturning a presidential election, getting the graphics on a Sonic the Hedgehog movie changed — these internet-based insurgencies tend to follow a similar pattern. One day, a group decides to take action against a system it feels is immoral or corrupt. Members identify structural weak points (a vulnerable political party, a risk-averse studio head, an overexposed short position) and figure out creative ways to exploit them, using social media for leverage and visibility. With enough highly motivated people pushing in the same direction, they eventually prevail, or get enough attention that it feels like they did.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/technology/gamestop-stock.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>The GameStop Reckoning Was a Long Time Coming<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>How do internet-based insurgencies work and how do they end up winning against a system they feel is immoral or corrupt?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>How do internet-based insurgencies work?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>Wall Street was among the last powerful institutions to be overrun by online populists, in part because it had a higher barrier to entry.

<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>There has been lots of screaming about what these companies did, but I want us all to recognize that there are few easy choices here.

<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>Dr. Turow’s suggestion is notable partly because the profiling of people based on their voices isn’t widespread. Or, it isn’t yet.

<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>The technology incorporates some hardware — such as a robotic arm in some instances — to paint the nails, with software that relies on machine learning to distinguish a fingernail from the surrounding skin. Each company uses a different approach, yet essentially relies on the scanning of thousands of nail shapes to create a database. Cameras within the devices take photos of the nails of the individual user, a process repeated each time a manicure is done even on the same person. During the development, all three have tried to minimize the number of moving parts and rely more on software, because moving parts can break down over time.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/technology/robot-manicure-nails.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Want Your Nails Done?

<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>Clockwork is the first to hit the market, although in a limited way. Last Friday, the company opened in a storefront space in the Marina District of San Francisco, essentially a pop-up location expected to be open for at least six months. Clients will pay $7.99 to test the device, which is slightly bigger than a microwave. The soft opening follows a 2019 test run in their office of a prior iteration with employees of Dropbox, where the Clockwork founders Renuka Apte and Aaron Feldstein first met.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2019 there were 155,300 jobs; average pay was $27,870 per year or $13.40 per hour (before tips).

Clockwork wants to maintain ownership, with its devices available for a quick change of color in offices, apartment buildings or retail stores for about $10, Ms. Apte said. Nimble’s product is geared for home use, and the company plans to sell directly to consumers and in retail outlets, Mr. Moran said, with an intended price of $399.

For the past few years, workers largely challenged Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, on his handling of inflammatory posts from former President Donald J. Trump.

Apple could not effectively police which apps find their way onto iPhones if Epic had its own app store, Mr. Kosmynka said.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/21/technology/apple-vs-epic-tim-cook.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>In Antitrust Trial, Tim Cook Argues Apple Doesn’t Hurt App Makers<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>Why Epic can't have its own app store?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>Why Epic doesn't have its own app store?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>In an attempt to tie Epic to unsuitable content, Richard Doren, a lawyer for Apple, brought up Peely, a cartoon banana in Fortnite that sometimes wears a tuxedo and sometimes goes nude. Mr. Doren implied that it would have been inappropriate to display Peely without a tuxedo in a federal court. Matthew Weissinger, vice president of marketing at Epic, clarified that Peely, naked or suited, was not scandalous.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/21/technology/apple-vs-epic-tim-cook.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>In Antitrust Trial, Tim Cook Argues Apple Doesn’t Hurt App Makers<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>Why is Epic Games being sued?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>How did Apple tie Epic to unsuitable content?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>On the line was Vijaya Gadde, Twitter’s top lawyer and safety expert, with an update from the real world. She said she and other company executives had decided to lock President Trump’s account, temporarily, to prevent him from posting statements that might provoke more violence after a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol that day.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/technology/twitter-donald-trump-jack-dorsey.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Inside Twitter’s Decision to Cut Off Trump<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>What happened to Twitter?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>Why did Twitter lock President Trump's account temporarily?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>Mr. Trump, who joined Twitter in 2009, was a boon and bane for the company. His tweets brought attention to Twitter, which sometimes struggled to attract new users. But his false assertions and threats online also caused critics to say the site enabled him to spread lies and provoke harassment.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/technology/twitter-donald-trump-jack-dorsey.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Inside Twitter’s Decision to Cut Off Trump<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>What did Mr. Trump do to bring attention to Twitter?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>What happened to Twitter?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>Many of Twitter’s more than 5,400 employees opposed having Mr. Trump on the platform. In August 2019, shortly after a gunman killed more than 20 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Twitter called a staff meeting to discuss how the gunman, in an online manifesto, had echoed many of the views that Mr. Trump posted on Twitter.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/technology/twitter-donald-trump-jack-dorsey.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Inside Twitter’s Decision to Cut Off Trump<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>What happened to Twitter in August 2019?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>Why did Twitter allow President Trump to use their platform?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>But Mr. Dorsey, a proponent of free speech, declined to take down world leaders’ posts, because he considered them newsworthy. Since Twitter announced that year that it would give greater leeway to world leaders who broke its rules, the company had removed their tweets only once: Last March, it deleted messages from the presidents of Brazil and Venezuela that promoted false cures for the coronavirus. Mr. Dorsey opposed the removals, a person with knowledge of his thinking said.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/technology/twitter-donald-trump-jack-dorsey.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Inside Twitter’s Decision to Cut Off Trump<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>Why did Twitter not take down the posts of world leaders who broke its rules?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>Why did Twitter not take down the posts of world leaders in 2015?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>Mr. Dorsey pushed for an in-between solution: appending labels to tweets by world leaders if the posts violated Twitter’s policies. In May, when Mr. Trump tweeted inaccurate information about mail-in voting, Mr. Dorsey gave the go-ahead for Twitter to start labeling the president’s messages.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/technology/twitter-donald-trump-jack-dorsey.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Inside Twitter’s Decision to Cut Off Trump<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>What is the solution to the problem of fake news on Twitter?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>What is the difference between labeling a tweet and just letting it be?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>But Mr. Dorsey was not sold on a permanent ban of Mr. Trump. He emailed employees the next day, saying it was important for the company to remain consistent with its policies, including letting a user return after a suspension.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/technology/twitter-donald-trump-jack-dorsey.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Inside Twitter’s Decision to Cut Off Trump<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>Why did Twitter allow users to return after being banned?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>What did Mr. Dorsey do after the ban?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>Twitter has also broadened its crackdown on accounts promoting violence. Over the weekend, it removed more than 70,000 accounts that pushed the QAnon conspiracy theory, which posits that Mr. Trump is fighting a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/technology/twitter-donald-trump-jack-dorsey.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Inside Twitter’s Decision to Cut Off Trump<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>What has Twitter done about accounts promoting violence?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>Why has Twitter removed so many fake accounts?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>That afternoon, Mr. Trump returned again to Twitter, this time using the official @WhiteHouse account to share a video saying he condemned violence — but also denouncing what he called restrictions on free speech. Twitter allowed the video to remain online.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/technology/twitter-donald-trump-jack-dorsey.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Inside Twitter’s Decision to Cut Off Trump<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>What happened after Mr. Trump "returned" to Twitter?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>What happened to the video of the president on Twitter?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>The oversight board also served another purpose. For years, Mr. Zuckerberg had been called in as Facebook’s policy judge of last resort. (In 2018, for example, he got personally involved in the decision to bar Alex Jones, the Infowars conspiracy theorist.) But high-profile moderation decisions were often unpopular, and the blowback was often fierce. If it worked, the oversight board would take responsibility for making the platform’s most contentious content decisions, while shielding Mr. Zuckerberg and his policy team from criticism.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/06/technology/facebook-oversight-board-trump.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Facebook’s ‘Supreme Court’ Tells Zuckerberg He’s the Decider<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>What was the purpose of the Facebook oversight board?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>What was the oversight board’s purpose in shielding Mr. Zuckerberg?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>It’s hard to imagine a dispute Mr. Zuckerberg would be more eager to avoid than the one about Mr. Trump. The former president rode Facebook to the White House in 2016, then tormented the company by repeatedly skirting its rules and daring executives to punish him for it. When they finally did, Republicans raged at Mr. Zuckerberg and his lieutenants, accusing them of politically motivated censorship.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/06/technology/facebook-oversight-board-trump.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Facebook’s ‘Supreme Court’ Tells Zuckerberg He’s the Decider<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>Why is the president of the United States calling for the resignation of Mark Zuckerberg?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>What dispute would Mr. Zuckerberg be more eager to avoid?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>But for all its claims of legitimacy, the oversight board has always had a Potemkin quality to it. Its leaders were selected by Facebook, and its members are (handsomely) paid out of the company’s pockets. Its mandate is limited, and none of its rulings are binding, in any meaningful sense of that word. If Mr. Zuckerberg decided tomorrow to ignore the board’s advice and reinstate Mr. Trump’s accounts, nothing — no act of Congress, no judicial writ, no angry letter from Facebook shareholders — could stop him.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/06/technology/facebook-oversight-board-trump.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Facebook’s ‘Supreme Court’ Tells Zuckerberg He’s the Decider<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>What is the quality of the oversight board that Facebook has appointed?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>How can the oversight board of Facebook be so much more powerful than the company itself?

<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>For people who may no longer require a permanent desk, Google also built a prototype desk that adjusts to an employee’s personal preferences with a swipe of a work badge — a handy feature for workers who don’t have assigned desks because they only drop into the office once in a while. It calibrates the height and tilt of the monitor, brings up family photos on a display, and even adjusts the nearby temperature.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/30/technology/google-back-to-office-workers.html<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>Google’s Plan for the Future of Work: Privacy Robots and Balloon Walls<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>How does Google’s new desk work?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>How does Google’s new desk adjust to personal preferences?

<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>Thankfully, Wi-Fi technology keeps getting better. This year, we will see a wave of new internet routers that include Wi-Fi 6, a new networking standard.

<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>Millions of people began flocking to Parler, a platform similar to Twitter, after the November presidential election, when mainstream sites like Facebook and Twitter became more aggressive about curtailing hate speech and misinformation.

<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>During his time leading Google, it has doubled its work force to about 140,000 people, and Alphabet has tripled in value. It is not unusual for a company that has grown so large to appear sluggish or unwilling to risk what has made it so wealthy. Mr. Pichai has taken some steps to counter that. In 2019, for example, he reorganized Google and created new decision-making bodies so fewer decisions needed his signoff.<br/><br/><br/><strong>SOURCE:</strong><br/>https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/06/11/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-mask/anthony-fauci-book-proceeds<br/><br/><br/><strong>HEADLINE:</strong><br/>No, Fauci is not profiting from a coming book on lessons he’s learned from his public service.<br/><br/><br/><strong>QUESTION 1:</strong><br/>Why is Sundar Pichai so hated?<strong>QUESTION 2:</strong><br/>How has Pichai managed to grow Google's work force?
<strong>PARAGRAPH:</strong><br/>His emphasis on the management team — rather than his ego — has led Mr. Pichai to get his deputies to make more decisions without him, the Google executives said.

To sum up the company’s last 15 years: Amazon operated a grocery-delivery service for a decade without much success. Then nearly four years ago it bought the Whole Foods chain of 500 grocery stores for more than $13 billion. That hasn’t been a smash.
